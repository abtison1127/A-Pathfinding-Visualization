# A-Star-Pathfinding-Visualizer
A program that visualizes the A-Star Algorithm using Pygame in Python3 as it runs. The A-Star Pathfinding Algorithm finds the shortest distance between given points by visiting the nearest vertices to its starting position recursively then expanding outwards until it reaches its given end point.

# INSTRUCTIONS

Run pathfinder.py in IDE or terminal to start the game.

The first mouse click on any square of the grid will become the START position (ORANGE).

The second mouse click on any other square on the grid will become the END position (BLUE).

Any other mouse click on any other square on the grid will become a BLOCK for the pathfinder (BLACK).
- Drag mouse click to create consecutive blocks

After setting blocks, press the SPACEBAR to run and watch the A-Star Pathfinding Algorithm in real time.

To clear the grid and start over during any part of the program, press C.
